/**
 * This is the configuration of the clients that are allowed to connected to your authorization
 * server. These represent client applications that can connect. At a minimum you need the required
 * properties of
 *
 * id:           A unique numeric id of your client application
 * name:         The name of your client application
 * clientId:     A unique id of your client application
 * clientSecret: A unique password(ish) secret that is _best not_ shared with anyone but your
 *               client application and the authorization server.
 *
 * Optionally you can set these properties which are
 *
 * trustedClient: default if missing is false. If this is set to true then the client is regarded
 * as a trusted client and not a 3rd party application. That means that the user will not be
 * presented with a decision dialog with the trusted application and that the trusted application
 * gets full scope access without the user having to make a decision to allow or disallow the scope
 * access.
